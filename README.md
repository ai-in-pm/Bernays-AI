## Disclaimer:

The Subliminal AI Agent project is solely for research and educational purposes. It is not intended for any therapeutic or commercial use.

This project explores the intersection of artificial intelligence, psychology, and neuroscience in a controlled research setting. The simulation of rogue behaviors is designed to advance our understanding of psychological influence and neural modulation techniques, particularly in the context of PTSD.

Important Considerations:

Ethical Oversight: This project must be conducted under strict ethical guidelines and with appropriate institutional review board (IRB) approval.
Participant Safety: The well-being of participants is paramount. Rigorous safety protocols must be in place to mitigate any potential risks associated with psychological and neural modulation.
Informed Consent: All participants must provide informed consent, fully understanding the nature and potential risks of the research.
Data Privacy: All data collected must be anonymized and securely stored in accordance with data privacy regulations.
This project is strictly prohibited for any application outside of controlled research and educational environments. Misuse of the technologies and knowledge gained from this research could have serious ethical and legal implications.
